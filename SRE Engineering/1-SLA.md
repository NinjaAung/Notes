# Service Level Agreemenet
A Service Level Agreement ( SLA ) are measureable [[Metrics]] between the client and provider that is agreed upon. Metrics like latency, quality and availability in relatioln to reliability.

***100% Reliability is the wrong target***

Failure is natural is system upkeep and 100% will always be a over promise and something the provider will always violate and not create an effective [[2-SLO]] down the path. A effective SLA should have these traits:

- Defining your promises to who (Developers,Users,Business)
- Defining how much reliability is good enough
- making realistic promises with clients as well as taking note of what **measurable** metric matters to the client to create reasonable [[2-SLO]]
- Creating consequences when SLA are violated
- Catching promblems before they meet the threshold with [[2-SLO]]
- Create Room For Failure

> It's important to note that when creating an SLA, be simple and direct, complicated [[1-SLA]] language can cause complication and distress with clients.
